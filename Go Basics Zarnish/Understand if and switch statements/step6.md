Below are flow control statements and their purpose.

- **if** - checks if one condition is fulfilled.
- **if...else** - checks if a condition is fulfilled and executes a set block of code if it’s true and another block if it’s false.
- **if...else if… else** - executes blocks of code after checking if more than two conditions are met.
- **switch...case** - selects the block of code to be executed from a group of blocks and conditions.
- Flow control statements are guided by boolean-type outputs.
