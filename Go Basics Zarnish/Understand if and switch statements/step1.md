Control flow statements allow us to execute blocks of code if set conditions are met. They can therefore be defined as conditional statements that allow us to test variables within the code logic.

There are four types of conditional statements:

- **if** - checks if one condition is fulfilled.
- **if...else** - Checks if a condition is fulfilled and executes a set block of code if it’s true and another block if it’s false.
- **if...else if… else** - Executes blocks of code after checking if more than two conditions are met.
- **switch...case** - selects the block of code to be executed from a group of blocks and conditions.

These statements will generate a boolean result after checking the condition. If the condition is fulfilled, the output is `true` and if it is not fulfilled the output is `false`.
