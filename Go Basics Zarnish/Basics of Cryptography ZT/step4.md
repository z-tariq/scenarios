title: Types of Cryptography

---

There are three types of cryptography techniques :

**Secret Key Cryptography (SKC):**
Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption; also called symmetric encryption. Primarily used for privacy and confidentiality.

**Public Key Cryptography (PKC):**
Uses one key for encryption and another for decryption; also called asymmetric encryption. Primarily used for authentication, non-repudiation, and key exchange.

**Hash Functions:**
Uses a mathematical transformation to irreversibly "encrypt" information, providing a digital fingerprint. Primarily used for message integrity. Cryptographic hash functions using 0 keys (the “key” is not a separate input but “appended” to or “mixed” with the data)
