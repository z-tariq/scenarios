title: Basics of Cryptography
---

**Cryptography**
— the science of secret writing
— is an ancient art; the first documented use of cryptography in writing dates back to circa 1900 B.C. when an Egyptian scribe used non-standard hieroglyphs in an inscription. Some experts argue that cryptography appeared spontaneously sometime after writing was invented, with applications ranging from diplomatic missives to war-time battle plans.

**Cryptography** describes a process of encrypting information so that its meaning is hidden from those who do not know how to decrypt the information. Over time many different approaches to cryptography have been used ranging from basic shifting of alphabetical letters to complex mechanical and electronic encryption methods.

Cryptography is a method to secure communication from unauthorized party and at its most fundamental level, requires two steps:

**Encryption**: The encryption process uses a cipher in order to encrypt plaintext and turn it into ciphertext.
**Decryption**: on the other hand, applies that same cipher to turn the ciphertext back into plaintext.
