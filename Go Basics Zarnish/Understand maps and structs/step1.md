Hash tables are very important for a developer because they make it easy to organize data. 

In programming, a hash table (sometimes called hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type. In other words, it's a structure that can map keys to values.

A hash table allows for fast edits or lookups when implementing the applicationâ€™s logic. 

In Go, hash tables are implemented using a built-in map type.

Assume you have the following data of students and their average score:

```
John - 82, Jane - 85, Kevin - 90, Mary - 80
```

The easiest way to use such a dataset in Go is by creating a hash table using maps.

Next, we will discuss how to create a map.
