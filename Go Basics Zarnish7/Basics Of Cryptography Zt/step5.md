title: How it Works
---

Here’s an example of how this works.

Let’s say that you wanted to encrypt a the simple message, “Hello”.

So our plaintext (message) is “Hello”.

We can now apply one of the simplest forms of encryption known as “Caesar’s Cipher” (also known as a shift cipher) to the message.

With this cipher, we simply shift each letter a set number of spaces up or down the alphabet.

So for example, the image below shows a shift of 3 letters.

Meaning that:

A = D
B = E
C = F
D = G
E = H
F = I
And so on.
By applying this cipher, our plaintext “Hello” turns into the ciphertext “Khoor”

To the untrained eye “Khoor” looks nothing like “Hello”. However, with knowledge of Caesar’s cipher, even the most novice cryptographer could quickly decrypt the message and uncover its contents.
