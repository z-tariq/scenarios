Golang introduced itself in the community when multicore architectures were common but there was hardly any programming language that simplified the development of multithreaded applications.

It has proved itself to be highly performant and scalable. Golang is a very efficient language, just like C/C++, handling parallelisms like Java, and has easy code readability like Python and pearl. Golang has indisputable architectural advantages over its predecessors.

Here's a list of some of the top companies in the industry building their services and products in Go:

- Cloudfare
- Netflix
- Riot Games
- Twitter
