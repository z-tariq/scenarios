title : Evolution of Go

Go is an open source programming language supported by Google, released in 2009. It is a statistically typed, compiled programming language designed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson. 

Syntactically, it is similar to `C` language but with the additional benefits of memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing and concurrency. 

It aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing.

Go is neither a functional nor an object-oriented programming language. It has some features you will often see in object-oriented programming languages, and other features you will often see in functional programming languages.

That was a brief introduction to Go, now lets move on to the details of some key features and benefits of Go.
